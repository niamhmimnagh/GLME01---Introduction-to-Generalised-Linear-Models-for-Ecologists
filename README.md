ðŸ“– Course Overview

This course introduces the GLM framework, moving from the classical linear model to models for non-Gaussian data using appropriate link functions and distributions. We emphasize interpretation, diagnostics, and clear communication of results.

    Topics covered

    - Recap of linear models and assumptions
    - GLM components: random component (distribution), systematic component (linear predictor), link
    - Common GLMs:
        -Logistic regression (binary outcomes)
        -Logistic regression (binomial outcomes)
        -Multinomial logistic regression (more than two outcomes)
        -Ordinal logistic regression (ordered outcomes)
        - Poisson regression (counts)
        - Quasi-models (overdispersed data)
        - Negative Binomial regression (overdispersed data)
        - Beta Binomial regression (overdispersed data)
        - Zero-inflated regression
    - Fitting and interpreting GLMs in R (glm)
    - Brief introduction to GLMMs
    - Brief introduction to Bayesian statistics
    - Model diagnostics and assumption checks


ðŸ“Š Data

The data/ folder contains simulated datasets used for exercises and demonstrations:

    plant_biomass.txt/.csv â€” Mean annual plant biomass vs rainfall (Gaussian/identity).

    disease_presence.txt/.csv â€” Disease presence (0/1) with predictors such as age (logistic).

    See scripts for import examples.

ðŸ’» Scripts

The scripts/ folder contains reproducible R code for:

    simulate_data.R â€” Code used to generate the datasets stored in data/.

    coding_demo.R â€” Step-by-step coding demonstrations (simulation, fitting, diagnostics, predictions, plots).

    Additional helper scripts as needed for particular sessions.

ðŸ“‘ Slides
The slides/ folder contains pdf. files of all lecture slides. 

    
ðŸ”§ Getting Started

  Clone this repository

    git clone https://https://github.com/niamhmimnagh/GLME01---Introduction-to-Generalised-Linear-Models-for-Ecologists.git

Open in R/RStudio (recommended).

Install required packages (used across demos; install as needed):

    install.packages(c(
    "ggplot2",    # plotting
    "MASS",       # negative binomial (glm.nb)
    "DHARMa",     # residual diagnostics for GLMs
    "pROC",       # ROC/AUC for logistic models
    "AER",        # dispersion test for Poisson models
    "pscl",       # zero-inflated Poisson / negative binomial models
    "effects",    # partial effect plots for GLMs
    "car",        # VIF, Anova, diagnostic tools
    "performance" # model performance checks
    ))

Run the demos

    Open files in scripts/ and run top-to-bottom to reproduce examples.

    Load datasets from data/:

        # Tab-delimited example
        biomass <- read.delim("data/plant_biomass.txt", header = TRUE)

        # CSV example
        disease <- read.csv("data/disease_presence.csv", header = TRUE)

        Or read directly from GitHub raw links if preferred.
